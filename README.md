# Blog Project
- Front-end: React w/ Typescript, and create-react-app template
- Back-end: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose

## Available Scripts

### `npm install`
- Ran from the root folder it should install all necessary dependencies for Client and Server Directory. If not all dependencies are installed at first, run `npm i` in Client and Server directory seperately.

### `npm run server`
- Ran from root directory should change to server directory and begin running back-end of app with nodemon.
 * Note * Necessary to create a .env file inside server directory with PORT variable (I use 3500) and CONNECTION_STRING for mongoDB cluster before script will run properly

### `npm run client`
-- Ran from root directory should change to client directory and begin running react app.
